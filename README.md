# Advanced-Encryption-Algorithm
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a widely adopted symmetric key encryption algorithm. It was established as a replacement for the aging Data Encryption Standard (DES). AES employs a block cipher, using fixed block sizes of 128 bits, with key lengths of 128, 192, or 256 bits.
